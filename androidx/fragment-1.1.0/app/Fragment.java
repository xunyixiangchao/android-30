/**
 * Static library support version of the framework's {@link android.app.Fragment}.
 * Used to write apps that run on platforms prior to Android 3.0.  When running
 * on Android 3.0 or above, this implementation is still used; it does not try
 * to switch to the framework's implementation. See the framework {@link android.app.Fragment}
 * documentation for a class overview.
 *
 * <p>The main differences when using this support version instead of the framework version are:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Your activity must extend {@link FragmentActivity}
 *  <li>You must call {@link FragmentActivity#getSupportFragmentManager} to get the
 *  {@link FragmentManager}

     * #PROTECTION_DANGEROUS dangerous}, regardless whether they are declared by
     * the platform or a third-party app.
     * <p>
     * Normal permissions {@link android.content.pm.PermissionInfo#PROTECTION_NORMAL}
     * are granted at install time if requested in the manifest. Signature permissions
     * {@link android.content.pm.PermissionInfo#PROTECTION_SIGNATURE} are granted at

     * the signature of the app declaring the permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your app does not have the requested permissions the user will be presented
     * with UI for accepting them. After the user has accepted or rejected the
     * requested permissions you will receive a callback on {@link
     * #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])} reporting whether the
     * permissions were granted or not.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee it will be granted and
     * your app should be able to run without having this permission.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This method may start an activity allowing the user to choose which permissions
     * to grant and which to reject. Hence, you should be prepared that your activity
     * may be paused and resumed. Further, granting some permissions may require
     * a restart of you application. In such a case, the system will recreate the
     * activity stack before delivering the result to {@link
     * #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])}.
     * </p>

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Calling this API for permissions already granted to your app would show UI
